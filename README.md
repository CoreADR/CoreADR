# CoreADR

**CoreADR** is an organization dedicated to documenting, evolving, and maintaining high-quality architectural decisions for long-living software systems.

We use **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)** as a first-class architectural artifact to ensure decisions are explicit, traceable, and understandable over time.

## 🎯 Mission

- Capture and preserve critical architectural decisions
- Improve transparency and shared understanding
- Build a reusable architecture knowledge base
- Support scalable, maintainable, and resilient systems
