# CoreADR

**CoreADR** is an organization dedicated to documenting, evolving, and maintaining high-quality architectural decisions for long-living software systems.

We use **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)** as a first-class architectural artifact to ensure decisions are explicit, traceable, and understandable over time.

---

## 🎯 Mission

- Capture and preserve critical architectural decisions
- Improve transparency and shared understanding
- Build a reusable architecture knowledge base
- Support scalable, maintainable, and resilient systems

---

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**  
  Structured records describing *why* and *how* architectural decisions were made.

- **Guidelines**  
  Architectural principles, standards, and best practices.

- **Reference Architectures**  
  Proven architecture patterns and baseline system designs.

- **Templates**  
  Reusable templates for consistent documentation.

---

## 🧠 ADR Philosophy

Every significant architectural decision should be:

- Documented
- Context-driven
- Justified with alternatives
- Easy to revisit and evolve

ADR is **not documentation for documentation’s sake** —  
it is the **decision history of the system**.

---

## 🏗 ADR Lifecycle

ADR documents follow a clear lifecycle:

`Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated / Superseded`

Each change in direction is recorded, not erased.

---

## 🚀 How to Add a New ADR

1. Copy the ADR template
2. Assign the next available ADR number
3. Describe context, decision, and alternatives
4. Set the appropriate status
5. Add the entry to the decision log
